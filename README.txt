This is the code for my professional website. You can see the result for yourself at www.dleybz.com

I used a free template provided by html5up.net. I credit the author with making a gorgeous design, and for having the kind-heartedness to share it freely with us less talented humans.

Here is the author's README:

Strata by HTML5 UP

Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of n33.co
(my personal site). Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
